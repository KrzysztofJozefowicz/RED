## Short term plans
- Usability improvements & comments formatting in table editors


## Notes
By default, Eclipse is shipped with limited heap size which impacts performance while working with bigger projects. It is recommended to increase Xmx and Xmx parameters to higher values. Memory allocation can be done via startup arguments or by editing eclipse.ini in Eclipse folder.
We recommend to set following lines to eclipse.ini :
```
-vmargs
-Xms512m
-Xmx1024m
```
For details visit Eclipse Wiki: https://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_How_do_I_increase_the_heap_size_available_to_Eclipse%3F

## Feedback
We would appreciate any feedback about RED - Robot Editor, especially in every day functions like editors usability, false positive validation errors, problem with source parsing& coloring, performance etc. We are open for improvements and new functionalities. Fell free to create issue in GitHub issue tracker.
