	<h2>Debugging Robot</h2>
	
	<p>Debug functionality is unique way of checking what is happening during TestCase and TestSuite execution.
	It works similar as debug functionality in most of programming languages - it allows to track execution of program 
	for checking unwanted behavior either on TestCase side or in tested software.
	</p>

	<p>It is important to note that Debug functionality works only with text editor (debug actions can be set 
	only there) therefore it is crucial to active it before switching to Debug perspective.
	</p>

	<p>Try to not make changes in script in Debug mode as Eclipse have a problem with following changes 
	respectful to Breakpoints.
	</p>
	
	<dl class="note">
	   <dt>Note:</dt>
	   <dd>Step-into works only for Robot written Keywords. If you wish to step-into Python Keywords, check 
	   <a href="robot_python_debug.html">Debug Robot and Python scripts</a> help content.
	   </dd>
	</dl>

	<h3>Basics</h3>
	
	<p>In order to work with Debug, save the file beforehand. If you made any changes in Table editors, close 
	and reopen file so changes will be visible in Source tab. Activate Source page and change to Debug perspective:
	</p>

	<p>Debug perspective looks as follows:</p>
	
	<img src="images/debug_2.png"/>
	<h4>Place breakpoint in RobotFramework executable code</h4>
	<p>First thing with working with Debug is to place at least one breakpoint. This allows RED to pause 
	Debug execution and activate Stepping options. To place breakpoint in Source view click on line in 
	script and under right click menu choose Add breakpoint. You can also add breakpoint directly by clicking 
	on line number in Source editor view. When successful, blue ball icon will appear next to it, new 
	breakpoint entry will be visible in Breakpoint lists.
	</p>

	<h4>Start Debug</h4>
	
	<p>To start debugging you need to <a href="ui_elements.html">launch</a> the configuration in debug mode. 
	For example by clicking on "green bug" icon at the top toolbar:</p>
	
	<img src="images/debug_3.png"/>

	<h4>Limiting TestCases to be debugged</h4>

	<p>Limit works just like TestCase limitation in Robot perspective. In order to limit which TC will be 
	executed in Debug, open 
	<a class="command" href="javascript:executeCommand('org.eclipse.debug.ui.commands.OpenDebugConfigurations')">
	Run -> Debug Configurations...</a> dialog and choose which cases should be executed:
	</p>

	<h3>Working with Debug</h3>
	
	<h4>Breakpoints and execution stepping</h4>

	<p>Breakpoints are essential items, each pause execution and allows to initiate Debug actions.
	When breakpoint line is activated during execution, following icons are active:
	</p>
	
	<img src="images/debug_5.png"/>
	
	<p>moving from left to right:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li><b>Skip All Breakpoints</b> - allow to continue execution onwards without stopping on defined breakpoints</li>
	    <li><b>Resume</b> - resumes test execution</li>
	    <li><b>Pause</b></li>
	    <li><b>Stop</b></li>
	    <li><b>Disconnect</b></li>
	    <li><b>Step Into</b> - <kbd>F5</kbd> - each <kbd>F5</kbd> key press will execute active line and move to next 
	    one. If active line consists Keyword or embedded TestCase, test executor will jump into item and execute 
	    it line by line. To exit from executing inherited items use Step Return (<kbd>F7</kbd>)</li>
	    <li><b>Step Over</b> - <kbd>F6</kbd> - each <kbd>F6</kbd> key press will execute active line and move to next 
	    one. If keyword exists in current line, keyword result will be returned without going into Keyword content</li>
	    <li><b>Step Return</b> - <kbd>F7</kbd> - allows to return to main TestCase execution from embedded TestCase 
	    or Keyword if Step Into was used before</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>List of breakpoints can be seen in upper right side of the Debug perspective in <b>Breakpoints</b> view:</p>
	
	<img src="images/debug_breakpoints.png"/>
	
	<ul>
	    <li>each breakpoint can be enabled/disabled</li>
	    <li>each breakpoint can be removed</li>
	    <li>for each breakpoint, action condition can be set:
			<ul>
				<li>Hit count: breakpoint pause execution only after selected number of previous hits. 
				Useful to activate breakpoint inside a loop statement on certain iteration</li>
	    		<li>Conditional: expression when pass will activate breakpoint. Expression should be in 
	    		RobotFramework syntax, for instance: <code>Should be Equal ${variable} 10</code></li>
    		</ul>
	    </li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Variables watch</h4>

	<p>Variables can be watched and changed during TestCase Debug. All actions related to variables are 
	accessible in <b>Variables</b> view which is shared with Breakpoints list. Variables are only shown 
	during TestCase execution.
	</p>
	
	<img src="images/debug_variables.png"/>
	
	<p>At the top of the list, TestCase variables are displayed followed by RF &nbsp; environmental variables.
	Each variable can be changed during test run during breakpoint event.
	When variable is changed, it is indicated by distinct colour in the list.
	</p>
